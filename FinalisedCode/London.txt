Jeremy Corbyn was hit by a revolt led by his deputy today over the expulsion of Labour members who voted for rival parties in the European elections.

Tom Watson called for an amnesty on members who did not back Labour last week, branding such a purge “spiteful”. It came after Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former communications chief, was expelled for saying on television that he had voted for the Liberal Democrats. 

The rebellion spiralled on social media today with the hashtag #expelmetoo trending on Twitter as users claiming to be party members dared the party to force them out.

Mr Campbell’s expulsion came as it was announced that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was formally investigating Labour over allegations of anti-Semitism. 

Tom Watson has called for an "amnesty" for Labour members who did not vote for the party (PA)
Mr Watson said today: “It is very clear that many thousands of Labour Party members voted for other parties last week. They were disappointed with the position on Brexit that a small number of people on the National Executive Committee inserted into our manifesto. They were sending the NEC a message that our position lacked clarity and they were right.

“It is spiteful to resort to expulsions when the NEC should be listening to members.” He added: “There should be an amnesty for members who voted a different way last week. We should be listening to members rather than punishing them.”

Mr Campbell’s partner, journalist Fiona Millar, a former adviser to Cherie Blair, put out a call to party members on social media to alert them if they had also got an expulsion letter from the party’s “central command”. 

Former Labour home secretary Charles Clarke also said he had voted Lib Dem, as did former defence secretary Bob Ainsworth and former Labour MP Fiona Mactaggart.

Liz Gratton, who set up the #expelmetoo hashtag, said she too voted Lib Dem. Other people claiming to be Labour Party members tweeted in response, such as Clive Norris, who wrote: “Please expel me too and refund my membership.”

Sarah Higgins tweeted: “I am a Labour Party member who supported the Lib Dems at the European Elections 2019 because Labour just won’t get off the fence & support a people’s vote.”

A Labour Party spokesman said: “To be absolutely clear, the way Labour Party members vote is a private matter. But publicly declaring or encouraging support for another candidate or party is against the rules and is incompatible with party membership.” Labour said Mr Campbell publicly and repeatedly said he voted for another party. 

The Labour Party rule book states that any member who supports a political organisation other than Labour or supports any candidate who stands against an official Labour candidate is automatically ineligible to be or remain a party member and is automatically excluded from membership.
