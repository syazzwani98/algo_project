Tornadoes swept through Ohio and Indiana on Monday night and into Tuesday morning, killing at least one person, injuring others and leaving a trail of widespread damage.

Footage on social media and from local news outlets showed homes torn apart, downed trees and power lines, and roads littered with debris. Emergency responders and homeowners were surveying the damage, which was spread across much of Ohio, and thousands of people were still without power.

In Celina, a city of about 10,000 people about 60 miles north of Dayton, an 81-year-old man was killed after the storm picked up a vehicle and slammed it into his home, said Mike Robbins, the Mercer County emergency management director. He said that at least seven people had been injured, three of them seriously, and that at least 40 homes had been destroyed or seriously damaged.

“We are a small, tight-knit community. Everybody knows each other,” Mr. Robbins said. “They help take care of each other but when you lose your home, it’s not easy.”

A series of storms also struck the Dayton area around 11:30 p.m., leaving “significant” damage and creating problems with the city’s water system, city officials said at a news conference on Tuesday morning. But even after the authorities responded to dozens of calls, including pulling people out of buildings, they reported just three minor injuries.

“I find that pretty miraculous,” said Chief Jeffrey L. Payne of the Dayton Fire Department, who credited early warnings to the public.

Mayor Nan Whaley encouraged residents to check on their neighbors, as many people remained without basic services. City officials announced a boil advisory for water, and there were around 60,000 power failures across Ohio on Tuesday morning, with the most in Montgomery County, home to Dayton.

“Our community has been tested before and we have always risen above it,” Ms. Whaley said at the news conference. “I have no doubt we will do so again today and in the coming week.”

A large tornado was confirmed near Trotwood, about eight miles northwest of Dayton. The National Weather Service called the situation “extremely dangerous” and “life-threatening.”

The weather service also confirmed that a tornado had touched down just south of Circleville, about 70 miles east of Dayton.

Other tornadoes were spotted but not immediately confirmed by the weather service. It said a suspected tornado had been seen traveling southeast near Vandalia, about 10 miles north of Dayton, and had crossed the path of the first tornado.

Ohio Task Force 1, an urban search and rescue team, said early Tuesday that it was supporting rescue efforts in Montgomery County.

The damage also extended to Indiana. The National Weather Service in Indianapolis said early Tuesday that it would send a team to survey tornado damage in Pendleton, about 100 miles west of Dayton and 35 miles northeast of Indianapolis.

The tornadoes were the latest to hit the Midwest, which has been pounded by severe storms and flooding this spring.

A brief but violent tornado tore a two-mile path through the outskirts of El Reno, a suburb of Oklahoma City, over the weekend. And just last week, a series of powerful tornadoes whipped across the Midwest, killing at least three people in southwestern Missouri and destroying buildings and homes in that state’s capital, Jefferson City.
