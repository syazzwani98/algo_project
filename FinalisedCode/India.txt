Tirupur tweaks training to script success story 
Tirupur tweaks training to script success story
Rajasekaran RK & V Mayilvaganan | Rajasekaran RK & V Mayilvaganan | Updated: May 3, 2019, 4:26 IST
    
Chennai: Tirupur has many success stories to its credit, but 549 schools in the district working in unison to ensure the highest pass percentage among state board students in Tamil Nadu is one that speaks of focus, integrity and an inherent change in the system that few can achieve. 
From being the eighth district in terms of pass percentage in Class XII boards two years ago, Tirupur scaled to the third position last year and reached numero uno status this year. The district again surprised everyone by having the highest pass percentage in the Class X board exams too. 
The feat was no coincidence, but the result of concerted efforts and a methodical approach of district education officials, teachers and students. Education officials say they adopted a two-pronged approach — coaching toppers to better their score by fine-tuning their capabilities and identifying slow learners to give them special attention. 
Since the pass percentage drops because of students failing in one or two subjects, teachers of those subjects, particularly maths, were assigned individual responsibility to help students score. "We collected a subject-wise as well as group-wise data about weak students and teachers were assigned to train those students. If a student can pass commerce, why not maths," asks S Shanthi, Tirupur chief education officer. "We concentrated more on the seven government schools with a high number of slow learners. For instance, with around 1,300 Class X students, the results of Jaivabai Corporation Higher Secondary school would make a huge difference to district’s pass percentage," she says. 
In these schools, students were segregated based on their performance and special classes were conducted in morning, evening and night. The students would have to study in the morning and write a test in the evening. 
The school authorities also focused on writing skills, which too brings in marks. Besides teaching them methods to write fast, authorities adopted a novel method during class tests. "Students were asked to finish the tests with whatever answers they knew. Then they would be given a second chance to study the answers that they didn’t know and write them later, and 50% marks would be given. This helped them to learn more and also increase their confidence," says Shanthi. 
Other innovative techniques were introduced by respective school headmasters to make way for holistic learning. "We started teaching yoga to students two years ago. I feel it’s the direct result of yoga that our school crossed 90% pass percentage this year in Class XII for the first time," says Palaniswamy, headmaster of Nanjappa corporation higher secondary school.

Collector K S Palaniswamy, brimming with pride, says the change in mindset is another reason for the results. Parents, especially from poorer families, have begun paying more attention to the education of their wards, unlike in the past. "There are odd jobs and income options even for school dropouts in Tirupur. So some parents used to pay less attention to the education of the children, instead looking for options to earn a living. But the officials over the past few years made them understand the need for studies," says a headmaster. "Many of our students were working in part-time jobs. We spoke to their parents to stop sending the children to work and ensured they focused on studies,’’ says a teacher from Nanjappa school. 
Meanwhile, education department officials in Virudhunagar, which used to top the charts in board exams, are disappointed this year. The district slipped from the third to the sixth position in SSLC results scoring 97.92% this year from 98.26% last year. "Most of the parents of government school students work in fireworks units and the uncertainty of their livelihood after the court ban could have impacted the performance of students,’’ says a headmaster in Virudhunagar.
